# Oliver Roeder

Hello! I'm on the job market. This summer, I taught data journalism at Harvard Summer School. During the 2019–20 academic year, I was a [Nieman Fellow](https://nieman.harvard.edu/alumni/class-of-2020/) at Harvard University studying artificial intelligence. Previously, I was a senior writer and the puzzle editor at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/).

Find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ollie) or send me [an email](mailto:roeder@uchicago.edu).

I am especially interested in games and competitive subcultures, political strategy, art and its market, and our artificially intelligent future. I did a PhD in economics with a focus on game theory. I live in Brooklyn, New York.

Below, you can find my [books](#books), a categorized selection of my [articles](#articles), some examples of my [data visualization](#data-visualization), and a selection of my [media appearances](#media-appearances).

## Books

*Seven Games: A Human History* (W.W. Norton, forthcoming Jan. 2022)

<img src="https://oroeder.github.io/seven-games.png" style="float:right;width:100px;"></a>

>For millennia, human beings have played games. For decades, computer scientists have developed artificial intelligence to beat the best human players—in checkers, chess, Go, backgammon, poker, Scrabble, and bridge, among others. This book is a narrative history of that human-machine collision and the battles for gaming supremacy. It is also an essay on what artificial intelligence and games mean for our species and its future.

[*The Riddler: Fantastic Puzzles from FiveThirtyEight*](http://riddlerbook.com/) (W.W. Norton, 2018)

<a href="http://www.riddlerbook.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://oroeder.github.io/riddler.png" style="float:right;width:100px;"></a>

>A collection of my weekly math columns and the first book under the FiveThirtyEight banner. Will Shortz called it "a modern, smart puzzle book, unlike anything I've seen before, whose math and logic challenges will stretch your brain in new ways."

I broke the story, using a huge web-scraped database of puzzles and microfilm dug up in the New York Public Library. The editor was dismissed shortly after publication. This story was a finalist for the investigation prize at the 2016 Data Journalism Awards.

It's a town of alien geothermal outcroppings and bad storms, reckoning with the creeping forces of Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, a "dark-sky movement" tries to keep the lights off.
